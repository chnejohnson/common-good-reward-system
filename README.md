# Common Good Reward System
## Abstract
The core idea of this project is that people use tokens as voice credit to buy vote in order to decide whether the smart contract mints new tokens to reward the sponsor and the participants of the proposal. The use case of this project is not for the internet community but for the local living in reality. Besides, it's not a business model to earn profit. The purpose of this project is dedicated to facilitating local common good which can be rewarded by giving tokens. The nature of this project is decentralized and altruism, so the first  proposal for voters to vote is the reward system itself.

## Game
There are 3 roles playing in this game.
1. **sponsor**: the person who **registries** a proposal and has a right to start voting period and waits to get the rewards or nothing.
2. **participants**: people who **join** the proposal by casting some token into the contract and wait voting result to get the interest reward or the contract would shrink the principle when the proposal is rejected.
3. **voters**: people who can **get 2000 free token** to **vote for** or **against** the proposal, or do nothing to cumulate token for voting proposal in the future.

### Quadratic Voting
In my contracts, 1000 token equal to 1 voice credit. So in the QV system you should use 1 voice credit(1000 tokens) to buy 1 vote, 4 voice credit(4000 tokens) buys 2 votes, and 9 voice credit buys 3 votes, and so on.

### Reward System
So the question is that how much tokens sponsor or participants get from the successful proposal?

When the proposal succeeds, sponsor can get ![(numOfVoters)/2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B80%7D%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Cfn_phv%20%5Cfrac%7BnumOfVoters%7D%7B2%7D) tokens, and in contrast, sponsor get nothing.

For the participants, he must transfer P token to the proposal of the contract, when the proposal succeeds and the ratio of voting result is pros to cons, he can get ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B80%7D%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Cfn_phv%20P%20*%281%20&plus;%5Cfrac%7Bpros%20-%20cons%7D%7Bpros%20&plus;%20cons%7D%29) tokens.
Otherwise, If the proposal is rejected, he would get ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B80%7D%20%5Cbg_white%20%5Cfn_phv%20P%20*%281%20-%5Cfrac%7Bcons%20-%20pros%7D%7Bpros%20&plus;%20cons%7D%29) tokens.

## Reference
The idea of this project mainly come from three inspiring masterpieces. The first one is a French documentary film named *Tomorrow* directed by Cyril Dion and MÃ©lanie Laurent in 2015. Their beautiful vision about local living economy and complementary currency are appealing to me.

The second one is Ethereum and its community. There are many creative ideas like [*Call-out assurance contracts*](https://ethresear.ch/t/call-out-assurance-contracts/466) by Vitalik, [*HumanityDAO*](https://humanitydao.org/), [*Writing a Dominant Assurance Contract*](https://programtheblockchain.com/posts/2018/05/01/writing-a-dominant-assurance-contract/) by Program the Blockchain, the idea of token curation markets, and [*A Risk Redistribution Standard for Practical Cryptocurrency Payment*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gOyQ5JLcmQ&fbclid=IwAR1G2BMhMITBNrNeHyzHh6AdOa76oy6gNLvxOID9MLKa8I9AIBG2WQeo9pk) by Hu Yao-Chieh & Lee Ting Ting.

Finally, it's an excellent book about political economy named *Radical Markets* written by Eric A. Posner & E. Glen Weyl. The idea of Radical Democracy in chapter 2 actually enlightens me to come up with the idea of markets in public goods.

There are more good works inspiring me on the internet or in my life I didn't referred, I just listed some of the important ones, and hoped the project can also inspire you to some degree.
